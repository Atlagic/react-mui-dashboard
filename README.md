# React MUI Dashboard

React MUI Dashboard is a React app that simulates a modern admin-style dashboard built with Material UI.

This project demonstrates:

- React Router – multi-page navigation within a single-page application 
- Material UI components – layout, navigation, tables, forms, and UI elements 
- State management – adding, filtering, and searching users 
- Dashboard architecture – organizing pages and shared layout components 
- Responsive UI design – adapting layouts across screen sizes
